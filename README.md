## Purpose

My motives for creating this website are three-fold:

1. Sola.com has many international students and interns
2. Many people viewing the Sola.com website are not native level Japanese speakers
3. I wanted to give back to Sola.com for the opportunity to intern with the company

## Hosting

GatsbyCloud

#### Homepage

The homepage consists of a clean dark overlay 



## Credits

This website would not be possible without the boilerplate and theme created by HTML5 UP. 

### Theme
HTML5 UP allows people to use their website templates to create seamless websites that are:

- fully responsive
- built on HTML5 and CSS3
- super customizable
- **FREE** under the Creative Commons

### Boilerplate
Can be found here:

## What I learned
Bootstrap and React play nicely together. React allows one to create reusable modules and Bootstrap lets me decorate them very quickly. 
Using a boilerplate meant that I could spend less time making things from scratch and more time organizing an existing template. 


## Challenges
I had to learn how routing worked using GatsbyJS. It took a few tries, but once it worked, creating pages became very easy.

## CSS Grid

The grid on this site was replaced with a custom version, built using CSS Grid. It's a very simple 12 column grid that is disabled on mobile. To start using the grid, wrap the desired items with `grid-wrapper`. Items inside the `grid-wrapper` use the class `col-` followed by a number, which should add up to 12.

Here is an example of using the grid, for a 3 column layout:

```
<div className="grid-wrapper">
    <div className="col-4">
        <p>Content Here</p>
    </div>
    <div className="col-4">
        <p>Content Here</p>
    </div>
    <div className="col-4">
        <p>Content Here</p>
    </div>
</div>
```
